 - The order of the keys / columns of the ``json`` output format is now
   deterministic and reflects the order of the columns in the executed query.

   a query is being executed.

 - Added initial auto-completion support for the internal ``\format`` and
   ``\r`` commands.

   that require an argument were called without argument.
