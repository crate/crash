Compatibility
=============

.. CAUTION::

   We recommend that you upgrade to the latest stable version of CrateDB
   whenever possible. And we also recommend that you use the version of Crash
   that is bundled with the version of CrateDB that you are using. This
   greatly minimises the chances of experiencing compatibility issues.

CrateDB tries to maintain `backwards`_ and `forwards`_ compatibility. However,
this is not always possible.

Known compatibility issues:

- Due to `information schema`_ changes, Crash versions 0.19 and earlier
  are not compatible with CrateDB versions 0.57 and later.

- For CrateDB versions 0.38.x and earlier, it is not possible to insert nested
  arrays or nested objects via Crash. You must use `CrateDB REST endpoint`_ or a
  `client library`_.

  CrateDB versions 0.39 and later allow you to insert nested arrays using
  `array constructors`_, and nested objects using `object literals`_.

- Crash client :ref:`commands <commands>` are only available since version 0.11
  and later.
