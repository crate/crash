Install
=======

Crash is bundled with `CrateDB`_ so there is typically no need to install it
yourself.

.. SEEALSO::

   For manual installation instructions, consult the `PyPI overview`_.

Run
===

If you are able to run the ``crate`` command (see `Running CrateDB`_), you
should be able to run the ``crash`` command. Both of these executable files
live inside the main CrateDB ``bin`` directory.

If the CrateDB ``bin`` directory is on your `PATH`_, you can start Crash like
so::

  sh$ crash

Otherwise, locate the CrateDB directory, and run it like so::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

When ``crash`` is run without any additional arguments, it will attempt to
connect to ``localhost:4200``. To connect to another host, use the ``--hosts``
flag. For example::

  sh$ crash --host 198.51.100.1

If you are experiencing a connection error, try the ``--verbose`` flag::

  sh$ crash --verbose

When run with ``--verbose``, Crash will print useful information about
what it is doing to `STDOUT`_. This includes connection attempts and full stack
traces (in the case of an error).

.. SEEALSO::

   For more help, see :ref:`run`.

Query
=====

When you run Crash, you will see something like this:

.. image:: startup.png
    :alt: A screenshot of Crash after startup

This is an interactive `shell`_. You can type any CrateDB SQL query at the
``cr>`` prompt.

Queries are autocompleted as you type:

.. image:: autocomplete.png

Once you have entered your query, hit :kbd:`Enter` to run.

You should see something like this:

.. image:: query.png
